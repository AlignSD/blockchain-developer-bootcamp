# EVO-Marketplace

# Motivation

I wanted to further my understanding of building a DAPP with an emphasis on Solidity and Chai. This project introduced me to Redux along the way and its way of handling states and interactions. As a user you are able to buy and sell my EVO coin with Ethereum on the Ropsten test network.
